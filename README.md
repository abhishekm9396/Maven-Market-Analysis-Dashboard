# Maven-Market-Analysis-Dashboard

Welcome to the Maven Market Analysis dashboard! This project involved, working with data from Maven Market, a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico and the United States, which helped me to go through the entire Business Intelligence workflow

The dashboard is designed to facilitate data-driven decision-making and enhance overall supply chain efficiency by fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

## Methodology

#### - Connecting & Shaping Data:
This step involved extract, transform, and load (ETL) our project data using Power Query, and explore query editing tools like text, numerical, date & time tools, grouping & aggregating tools, etc. during table transformation stage.

#### - Creating a Relational Data Model:
Data modeling involved building snowflake schema by creating active & inactive relationships, etc.

#### - Adding Calculated Fields with DAX:

Using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), created calculated columns & measures like - 'Total Revenue', 'Total Transactions', 'YTD Revenue', '% Weekend Transactions', '60-day Revenue', 'All Transactions', etc. This helped me to explore Math & stats functions, Conditional & logical functions, Text functions, Date & time functions, RELATED function, CALCULATE, ALL, Iterator (X) functions, Time intelligence patterns and more.

#### - Visualizing Data with Reports:

And then final step was about bringing our data to LIFE with reports and dashboards. Used visuals like Cards & KPIs, Table & matrix, Map, Trend lines, etc. and tools like Conditional formatting, Top N filtering. Report slicers, bookmarks, tooltips, report navigation helped to add interactivity.
